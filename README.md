## 💡 The Problem
Keeping up with Artificial Intelligence is becoming a full-time job. Between X (Twitter) threads from researchers, endless blog posts from OpenAI/Anthropic, and technical tutorials, the signal-to-noise ratio is overwhelming. Leaders and developers often have to visit 10+ different sites just to stay informed.

## 🚀 The Solution
**AI Pulse** is an automated "Executive Brief" generator powered by Google's **Gemini 2.5/3 models**. It acts as your personal AI analyst, crawling high-signal sources and synthesizing them into a clean, newspaper-style interface.

It brings **everything to one page**, so you don't have to go anywhere else to learn.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Automated Source Monitoring
The app uses Gemini to "crawl" and filter content from a curated list of high-value sources, including:
*   **Labs:** OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Hugging Face.
*   **Leaders:** Andrew Ng, Yann LeCun, Andrej Karpathy, Fei-Fei Li.
*   **News:** STAT News (Healthcare), TechCrunch, MIT Tech Review.

### 2. The Daily Newspaper
Instead of a feed of links, AI Pulse generates **self-contained summaries**.
*   **Healthcare & Life Sciences:** Dedicated section for clinical and biotech AI news.
*   **Tech Landscape:** Broader model releases, policy, and infrastructure news.
*   **Social Wire:** Filters out the noise on X/Twitter. Only shows "Hot Takes," research previews, and announcements from verified research leaders.

### 3. Deep Learning Spotlight (No Click-Throughs Needed)
We integrate directly with **DeepLearning.AI sources (The Batch & Blogs)**.
Instead of just linking you to an article, Gemini reads it and generates a **detailed study guide** within the app. You can read the full technical summary without leaving the dashboard.

### 4. Hands-on POC Lab
For developers, the app generates daily **Proof of Concept (POC) Guides**.
*   Step-by-step tutorials for Google Vertex AI and Gemini.
*   Includes code snippets and architectural concepts.
*   Categorized by difficulty (Beginner to Advanced).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
*   **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-flash-preview` for reasoning).
*   **Storage:** LocalStorage (simulates a persistent database for daily archives).
